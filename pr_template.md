## Requirements
Please check off which features you have implemented:
- [x] A catchy name and title with a cool font!
- [x] An interesting and beautiful frontend design with a catchy title and cool fonts and colors that looks good on any screen size.
- [x] A home page with a summary about the interesting thing you want to teach me about. I was originally planning for this to be purely academic (e.g. math, CS, physics, engineering) topics but I am expanding it to include anything. However, you should be able to teach about whatever you choose in a clear way and go in-depth about it. If your subject matter is particularly engaging, that will reflect positively on your application.
- [x] Extra pages with more detailed information on certain topics. Make your website intuitive to navigate through, both within the pages themselves and in your choice of pages. You can structure your website however you see fit.
- [x] A poll/quiz feature where you can check that the user is aborbing the information your website teaches about well. These quiz questions should be scattered throughout the website, and they should tell the user whether they got the answer right or not once they select it. Additionally, it should show a live count of results (like a social media poll) with the names of the users who have voted for each option. You should take time to make sure your UI for this component is intuitive to use while still including all of the features listed. A user should be able to change their result if they want, and this should be reflected in the result count.
- [x] A comment feature on each page where users can offer feedback or ask questions based on the lesson on the page. The home page does not need a comment section, but every other page should have one.
- [x] Deploy the frontend and backend if you can using some of the free deployment tools we talked about in the workshops!

## Written Portion
1. **How did the project go? What parts of it did you most enjoy / find yourself good at?**

I enjoyed it. I play Rocket League a lot, so it was fun to make a website based on something that I spend a lot of time doing. Overall, I think the project went well as I was able to add all of the features, but I didn't really get around to testing. I most enjoyed deployment using vercel as I have never done that before on my own and I also enjoyed using Firebase since I haven't had much experience with it in the past. I found that the parts I am good at are defintely to do with the backend (mostly because I used copilot for most of the frontend). 

2. **Was this technical assessment what you expected? If you had another two weeks to work on it, what would you add or change?**

I thought there would be more specificity and maybe boilerplate code, but this was better because it felt like I was starting from scratch for a hackathon rather than submitting an assessement for an application, which I thought was better for me. If I had another two weeks to work on this project, I would have definitely recorded my own videos and put them on the website to serve as tutorials and tips for improvement in the game. I also would have added images, and in general, just more visuals. In terms of backend code, I could have included authenticated login and maybe even access to personal account tracking if one has played Rocket League before, and maybe added a chatbot with instructions for personalized recommendations. However, I am happy I was able to include all the features which were asked of me in completing this technical assessement.
